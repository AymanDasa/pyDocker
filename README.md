# pyDocker
The code is a Python script that provides a simple command-line interface to manage Docker containers. It uses the Docker SDK for Python to communicate with the Docker daemon, allowing the user to list all containers, start, stop, create new containers, and delete them. The user can select an option by typing a number or quit the program by typing 'q'. The script also defines a class bcolors that contains ANSI escape codes to print colored text in the terminal. Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and readable, with informative comments that explain the purpose of each section of the code.
